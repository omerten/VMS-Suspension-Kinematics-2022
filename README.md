# VMS-Suspension-Kinematics-2022
Copy of 2021 Kinematics Capstone materials to use as a sandbox

I am Oliver, the suspension lead for VMS 2022 Competition year. I was on the team last year and designed the drivetrain assembly.
This year I hope to improve our suspension design and have a functional, sturdy suspension to get our car moving and turning.
